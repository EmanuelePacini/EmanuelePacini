# MY SITE

My name is **Emanuele Pacini** i'm a Game Developer in particular a Programmer.
I'm attending the last yaer at [TheSign Comics & Arts Academy](https://thesign.academy/).
At the moment I have no particular field, but i'm interested in A.I programming (not only for GameDev)
during these three years of school I participated in two projects

# School Progect
* ## RoccaTrain  (We did not have an official name)

  The project of our first year, a "action game" in 3d where the player controlled a mcchina and had to assault a train (hence the name)
  The goal of the game was obviously to destroy the train, that would have answered our fire
