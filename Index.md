# MY SITE

My name is Emanuele Pacini i'm a Game Developer in particular a Programmer.
I'm attending the last year at [TheSign Comics & Arts Academy](https://thesign.academy/).
At the moment I have no particular field, but i'm interested in A.I programming (not only for GameDev)
During these three years of school I participated in two projects

# School Project
* ## RoccaTrain  (We did not have an official name)

  The project of our first year, a "action game" in 3d where the player controls a car armed with guns, and had to assault a train (hence the name)
  The goal of the game was obviously to destroy the train, that would have fired back

* ## Unum

  The game of the second and third year that we are still developing.
  This game is a single player game where your goal is to defeat various more and more complicated bosses, and your only ability is to       dash so you have to understand how to overcome obstacles in front of you without being able to do any kind of damage to enemies that
  will appear in front of you
